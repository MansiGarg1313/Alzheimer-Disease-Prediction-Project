# Alzheimer Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict Alzheimer’s disease progression using advanced machine learning techniques. The study explores various clinical and imaging data to develop predictive models for identifying and understanding factors contributing to Alzheimer’s disease.

## Dataset
The dataset includes clinical, demographic, and imaging features related to Alzheimer’s disease. Key attributes:
- Patient demographic details
- Cognitive scores
- MRI-based imaging biomarkers

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing data handling
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalization and scaling of numeric features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution and summary statistics
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of key relationships

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Feature selection techniques

4. **Model Development**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision and Recall
   - AUC-ROC Curve

## Results
- Key features contributing to Alzheimer’s prediction identified.
- Model comparison and performance evaluation using standard metrics.
- Visualizations for insights on feature importance and prediction results.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `tensorflow`

## Running the Notebook
1. Install required dependencies.
2. Load the dataset into the appropriate directory.
3. Execute the notebook sequentially.

## Future Work
